# Ti-nspire
All of the ti-nspire functions I have created to date


## Mux
This creates a simplified mnemonic truth table using some variables from 1-5 (a,b,c,d,e). This is especially useful in mux implementation. Simply choose the number of variables and the variable you wish
to change. Once completed, enter the truth table as one long string of characters (00101001), and the program will give you a modified truth table in order. Simply copy this into a ti-nspire program and upload it on 
your calculator.
